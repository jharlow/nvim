# `nvim` dotfiles

For the most part, this is a simple fork of [`AstroNvim/AstroNvim`](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim), with most plugin configuration managed by [`AstroNvim/astrocommunity`](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocommunity).

I'm open sourcing this project because a few people have asked how I've specifically configured some items like `snippets`, Typescript, and color schemes. However if you are looking for a good place to start your own config, I recommend starting with a stock `AstroNvim` config and taking aspects of this repo that you like. Their documentation will be more up-to-date, and I found it easy to configure as an absolute novice.
